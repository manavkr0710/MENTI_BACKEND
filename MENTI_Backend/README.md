## About MENTIChatBot
This is the part of the MENTI project that incorporates the Mental Health Chat Bot that is hosted by GPT 3.5-turbo, using a generated API key for the host to be connected to the chatbot. 
It is an interactive chatbot that grabs the user's daily activities and provides feedback to them.

## Why use MENTIChatBot
This chatbot provides responses and advice to the user when the user is prompted of what activities they did on a daily basis. The chatbot gives connstructive feedback, such as how
each physical activity benefits them, as well the next steps to improve. It is a good way for the user to have a general idea of how they are doing with their mental health, and what they can 
do to improve it.
